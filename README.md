# Publish RPMs on GitHub Pages

Simple example of publishing an RPM on GitHub Pages.

Long term goals would be reworking this proof of concept into a version that
* only puts the actual repodata on pages
* uploads a signed RPM to the GH releases
* uses semrel, etc

I'm not sure if this is currently possible out of the box and digging deep
for workarounds isn't currently in scope.
